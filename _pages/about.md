Hello! My name is **Endalkachew H. Chala**. I’m a researcher and educator specializing in **journalism, digital communication**, and **political media systems**. My scholarly work centers on *communities in liminality*—groups navigating shifting identities, political uncertainties, and transitional social structures after leaving their home countries and resettling in places such as the United States and Europe. I investigate how these communities use digital media to shape public discourse, engage in activism, and negotiate narratives of conflict, belonging, and reconciliation.

My research employs **qualitative and quantitative methodologies**—including *ethnographic fieldwork*, *comparative content analysis*, and *digital research techniques*—to study phenomena such as **diaspora activism**, **online surveillance**, **platform governance**, **internet shutdowns**, and **content moderation**. I’m particularly interested in how digital media influence the **social, political, and cultural experiences** of resettled communities.

As an educator, I have taught diverse communication courses—including **public speaking**, **intercultural communication**, **digital journalism**, and **media ethics**—at institutions such as **Hamline University**, the **University of Oregon**, and **Arba Minch University**. My pedagogy emphasizes *student-centered engagement*, *civic responsibility*, and *connections between local storytelling and global information systems*. I integrate **digital research methods** into my teaching to equip students with critical analytical skills and practical knowledge.

Beyond academia, I’ve contributed actively to journalism as an **editor at Global Voices**, a role involving international reporting and digital advocacy. Additionally, I curate the **African Media & Communication Research Library**, a [Zotero-based resource](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2522868/african_media_and_communication_research_library) supporting scholars studying African media systems.

Since 2010, I’ve maintained my blog—[**endalk.blog**](https://endalk.blog)—where I regularly share analyses and commentary on **journalism, technology, democracy**, and **cultural issues**. The blog also hosts my newsletter, providing deeper reflections on my research and journalistic projects.
