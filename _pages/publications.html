<h1>Research</h1>

<p>
  My research explores the intersections of journalism, political communication, and digital media systems in Ethiopia and the African diaspora. I focus on communities in liminality—those navigating displacement, resettlement, and contested identities—and how they use digital platforms to shape discourse, mobilize support, and challenge dominant narratives.
</p>

<p>
  I employ a mix of qualitative and computational methods including ethnographic fieldwork, semi-structured interviews, comparative content analysis, and digital scraping. My work is grounded in African media systems and informed by global conversations on platform governance, content moderation, and digital resistance.

<h3>The Digital Public Sphere at the Local Level</h3>
<p>
  A comparative study of local newsrooms in the Twin Cities (MinnPost, Sahan Journal, and TwinCities.com), this research explores how these outlets foster or fragment community dialogue through social media, comment sections, and editorial strategies.
</p>

<h3>Journalist Safety in Conflict Zones</h3>
<p>
  This project examines the evolving risks facing Ethiopian journalists, particularly during periods of state violence and conflict. It traces strategies for survival, self-censorship, and resistance from 1992 to the post-Tigray War era.
</p>

<h3>Media Framing of the Tigray Conflict</h3>
<p>
  A qualitative content analysis comparing Ethiopian government-owned media (<em>Addis Zemen</em>, <em>The Ethiopian Herald</em>) with U.S. press (<em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>), focusing on narrative framing, sourcing, tone, and audience positioning from November 2020–2022.
