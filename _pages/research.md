My research explores the intersections of journalism, political communication, and digital media systems in Ethiopia and across the African continent. I focus on communities in liminalityâ€”those navigating displacement, resettlement, and contested identitiesâ€”and how they use digital platforms to shape discourse, mobilize support, and challenge dominant narratives. This includes a particular emphasis on resettled communities in the United States, especially those from the Horn of Africa, whose digital media practices offer insight into transnational activism, diasporic identity formation, and platform-based public engagement.

I also study media systems in the Sub-Saharan African context more broadly, examining how social platforms are reconfiguring political discourse, institutional trust, and social relations. My work is grounded in African media systems and informed by global conversations on platform governance, content moderation, and digital resistance.

I employ a mix of qualitative and computational methods, including ethnographic fieldwork, semi-structured interviews, comparative content analysis, and digital scraping.
