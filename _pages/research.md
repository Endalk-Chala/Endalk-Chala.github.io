My research examines the interplay between journalism, political communication, and digital media systems, with a regional focus on Ethiopia, the broader Sub-Saharan context, and resettled communities in the United Statesâ€”particularly those from the Horn of Africa. At its core, my work interrogates how communities in liminalityâ€”those navigating displacement, sociopolitical uncertainty, and reconfigured identitiesâ€”use digital platforms to construct public narratives, engage in civic discourse, and negotiate transnational belonging.

In these liminal spaces, digital technologies not only mediate political expression but also reshape interpersonal communication and social cohesion. I explore how online engagement transforms everyday interaction, erodes or reinforces trust, and influences how individuals and communities experience and perform identity across borders.

My research draws on a mixed-methods approach that integrates ethnographic fieldwork, qualitative content analysis, and digital tools such as web scraping, data visualization, and computational text analysis. These methods allow me to trace how platform infrastructures shape discursive norms, mediate institutional trust, and reconfigure both interpersonal communication and broader public spheres. This page serves as a space for curating my research process, sharing datasets, and promoting transparency in scholarly work. It also reflects my broader commitment to advancing the use of digital methodologies within African media and communication research, where such tools remain underutilized. Grounded in African media ecologies and diasporic experiences, my work contributes to global conversations on platform governance, content moderation, and the communicative dynamics of digital resistance.
