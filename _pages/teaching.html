# Teaching

As an educator, I approach the classroom as a space for inquiry, reflection, and dialogue. I encourage students to critically examine how communication shapes individual identity, community relationships, and broader political and cultural structures. Whether teaching media theory or public speaking, I emphasize engaged pedagogyâ€”drawing connections between academic content and the lived experiences of students, especially those from historically underrepresented communities.

I have taught at a range of institutionsâ€”public and private, in the United States and Ethiopiaâ€”working with diverse student populations including first-generation college students, multilingual learners, and international students. Across these contexts, I aim to foster inclusive and participatory learning environments where students not only analyze media and communication but also practice them as tools for civic engagement and social change.
